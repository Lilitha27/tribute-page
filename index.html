   <div class="content" > <h1>History of Chris Hani</h1></hr>
        
        <p>Thembisile Hani was born on 28 June 1942 in the small town of Cofimvaba, Transkei. He was the fifth of six children and he attended Lovedale school in 1957, to finish his last two years. He twice finished two school grades in a single year.
            When Hani was 12 years old, after hearing his father's explanations about apartheid and the African National Congress, he wished to join the ANC but was still too young to be accepted.In Lovedale school, Hani joined the ANC Youth League when he was 15 years old, even though political activities were not allowed at black schools under apartheid. He influenced other students to join the ANC.</p>
            

        <p>In 1959, at the University of Fort Hare in Alice, Eastern Cape, Hani studied English, Latin and modern and classical literature.He did not participate in any sport, saying "I would rather fight apartheid than play sport".Hani, in an interview on the Wankie campaign, mentioned that he was a Rhodes University graduate.</p>

      <p class="show">Chris Hani emulated the example of Moses Kotane. He had joined the ANC Youth League in 1957 at the age of 15 and by 1982 had become a member of the ANC National Executive Committee.In 1991, he again followed in the footsteps of the great Kotane by becoming General Secretary of the SACP.</p>

        <p class="hide" >As a true Communist, Chris Hani was a proletarian internationalist, in 1967 he was part of the joint ZIPRA - MK force. ZIPRA, the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army was the army of the Zimbabwe African People's Union, ZAPU. The joint force crossed the Limpopo from Zambia and began the first armed resistance against the Smith regime in Zimbabwe, then called Rhodesia in the Wankie and Sipholilo Campaigns. Here he worked with the Zimbabwean military leaders Dumiso Dabengwa and Rex Nhongo and he retained a close relationship with the Zimbabweans for the rest of his life. How he would have hated xenophobia and despised those who perpetrate vicious acts against other Africans.</p>

    <p>In 1969, he wrote the famous "Hani Memorandum" ,this document developed a sharp constructive self-criticism of our liberation movement in exile and was concerned with the plight of MK combatants and the imperative to push the struggle in the home front. This criticism was useful as it led to the watershed Morogoro Conference of 1969 and the establishment of the Revolutionary Council which was to direct and organise the struggle from then until victory.

            It was this exemplary history as a Communist which led the counter-revolutionaries to select Comrade Chris as their prime target in 1993. This choice was no accident: it was (from their point of view) an informed and deliberate choice. Chris Hani, more than any other person at this time, was likely to have led the people far beyond merely ending apartheid - and they knew it.</p>
<h4 id="Chris Hani's Quotes">Chris Hani's Quotes</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Socialism is not about big concepts and heavy theory. Socialism is about decent shelter for those who are homeless. It is about water for those who have no safe drinking water. It is about health care, it is about a life of dignity for the old. It is about overcoming the huge divide between urban and rural areas. It is about a decent education for all our people. Socialism is about rolling back the tyranny of the market. As long as the economy is dominated by an unelected, privileged few, the case for socialism will exist.</li>

    <li>If you want peace then you must struggle for social justice.</li>

    <li>I've never wanted to spare myself because I feel there are people who are no longer around and died for this struggle. What right do I have to hold back, to rest, to preserve my health, to have time with my family, when there are other people who are no longer alive - when they sacrificed what is precious: namely life itself.</li>

    <li>The perks of a new government are not really appealing to me. Everybody would like to have a good job, a good salary.....but for me that is not the all of struggle. What is important is the continuation of the struggle... the real problems of the country are not whether one is in Cabinet ...but what we do for social upliftment of the working masses of our country.</li>
